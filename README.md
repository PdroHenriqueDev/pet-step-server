# Pet Step Backend

## About the Project

**Pet Step** was a personal project that was in production and served as the backend for two **React Native** applications: one for pet owners and another for dog walkers. The main goal of the platform was to connect dog owners with walkers, ensuring safety, convenience, and transparency during walks.

This backend was designed with a focus on scalability, security, and performance, utilizing modern technologies and hosted on AWS. Now, the project has been discontinued and is open-sourced for learning and reference purposes.
